#H3 Conference - Friday#

##<a name="intro">Intro Keynote</a>##
####Carlos Cobian####

* The Hipster, the Hustler and the Hacker cannot continue to stay apart. Only together can they make magic. 
* The purpose of the conference is to  educate and empower these three parties in order to inspire improvement in the economical struggles of Puerto Rico. 

## <a name="bill">Keynote - Bill Aulet - Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepeneurship</a> ##
@BillAulet 

* SPIRIT + SKILLS
* Entrepeneurship is where the jobs are.
* New jobs come from new companies. 
* Innovation-Driven Entrepeneurship - Your idea needs to be bigger than PR and have the potential to succeed in larger markets (like US).
* Entrepeneurship should be taught differently.
* Who First, Why Second, How will sort itself out once you've answered 1 and 2.
* A dangerous obsession with MVP - TechCrunch (link)
* It's all about specifics, you don't win with generalities.
* Book - Disciplined Entrepeneurship

##<a name="henrik">Henrik Scheel - Founder & CEO - startupexperience.org</a>##
* Good ideas are everywhere!
* Understand Context - your customers/products depend on it.
* Failure builds experience. Investors would rather put their money in someone who has failed than someone who has never done it before.
* When pitching a product, always talk about the problem first. 
* Tackle 1 problem with 1 solution for 1 market. 
* Understand the difference between interesting problems and important problems.
* Interesting problems are bad because you have to convince the customer that they have the problem first and then convince that your solution solves the problem.
* There will always be someone with the same idea.
* Failing faster is failing cheaper.
* No excuses!

#####Why do startups fail:#####
* No communication
* Crappy products that target everyone

#####Startup Co-Founder: #####
* Works before the money is available
* Will do any job proactively
* Is not afraid to share ideas
* Communicates effectively
* Celebrates mistakes
* Intelligence, Drive & Integrity (Integrity being the most important.)

## <a name="grace">Minimum Viable User Experience</a> ##
####Grace Ng####
#####Quick MVP#####
#####LeanStartupMachine#####

* MVP should be an experiment that tests your riskiest assumption.
* [Experiment Board](http://bit.ly/xB0D)

How to measure success?
1. Cost
2. Metrics

* Interview your target customers before building something in order to validate your idea.
* You don't have to build anything to collect data on your customer.
* MVUX - you create your wireframes based on existing customer data because you have identified what the customer problems are based on your interviews, etc.
* This makes the Lean Startup loop go faster because you are doing it incrementally.

##### Macarena Gil #####
##### Wireless Idea #####  
* Watch this: [Tim's Place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6He0FWoFj0)

* Figure out your personal values.
* Get key people's personal values.
* Combine people's values.
* Send to entire company or your group and ask for feedback

Culture Canvas 

If you have a hackathon, you should also have a CULTURETHON. It's the same as a hackathon but focusing on improving the work environment.

#####Recruitment#####
* Cultural Fit
* Roles (Flexible)
* Employee Appreciation
* "Our environment determines our thoughts"
* Culture is the one thing your competitors can't copy


##<a name="donna">Donna Novitsky - Creating Markets While Creating Products</a>##
##### Entrepeneurship Instructor - Stanford School of Engineering #####
#####CEO Yiftee#####

* Product and Market development need to happen simultaneously.
* Customers care about themselves.
* Comprehend, Competent, Care - you need to demonstrate these to your customers.\

Market Development Cycle:
* Exploratory Meetings
* Product Feedback & building credibility
* Paying customers!
* References
* A market is born!

Four common mistakes:
* Starting to sell too late
* Over-emphasizing the product
* Big company prodruct testing process
* The launch fizzle

You should launch when you have paying, referenceable customers.

Takeaways:
1. Don't wait for product availability
2. Build credibility
3. Identify MVP
4. Make SURE your initial customers are strong references and will hep with launch.
